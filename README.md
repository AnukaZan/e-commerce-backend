# Description 
I built the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation 
This application requires Node.js, Express.js, SQL2, and Sequelize. To connect to the database run `mysql -u root -p` and enter your MYSQL password and source the schema.sql. To seed the file run `npm run seed`. Connect to the server by running `npm start`. 

## Usage 
This application will allow users to view, add, edit, and delete categories, products, and tags.
